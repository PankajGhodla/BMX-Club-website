                <h2>President's News</h2>
                <p>It has been two weeks since our mid-year party and rider demonstration. It was great to have our guest pro rider, Max Jacobs, come along and demonstrate some of his jumps and share with us what he has been doing on the international circuit. Max is currently riding in California and hopes to visit us again when he returns home to New Zealand near the end of the year. Our track has seen some changes over the last six weeks with the upgrade of the canteen building, four new sets of security lights, and the placement of the two new containers to our track extension. Thanks to everyone who has helped and given up their valuable time to make these improvements possible. </p>

                <p>The ProGate fundraising is going well and we should reach our target of $50,000 in the next four months prior to the club’s open event early next year. Thanks to all the sponsors who have kindly donated money toward the ProGate purchase. Please remember to return all money and raffle tickets to Jack Samuels, our Treasurer, as soon as you have finished selling your tickets. We will continue with the monthly raffle until the end of the year. Thank you to all the members who have generously given their time and money to help us have one of the best club facilities in the country. These fundraising are invaluable to purchase and maintain our equipment and tracks.</p>
