                <h1>Getting Started</h1>
                <h2>Want to get started in BMX racing? Follow these steps:</h2>
                <p>Contact a club and find out when their club night races are held. This will give you an idea of when you can ride competitively. West Auckland BMX races on Friday nights, rider registration starts at 5.30pm, racing starts normally around 6:45pm. Richard Fox is the guy to contact - call him on 021 468 463, or email him at rdhfoxy@hotmail.com. The BMX racing season in NZ runs from Sept through till May (with some movement either side of those dates sometimes).</p>

                    <h2> &#10102; Go to your nearest track and watch a club night race meeting.</h2>
                    <p>Being at a club night race meeting will give you an idea of whether or not you think BMX is for you. Ask questions while you're there, BMX people are helpful. If you're checking this all out for your son or daughter, it's worth noting that many kids really like riding the tracks, but the competitive nature of the racing is not necessarily for them. Take your son or daughter with you to see if they like the look of the racing itself.</p>

                    <h2>&#10103; If you've got a BMX bike, get to the track and ride around slowly. Wear your safety gear.</h2>
                    <p>Most of the tracks in New Zealand are open to the public at any time that they are not being used by the clubs. PLEASE wear a helmet, gloves and cover your skin with a long sleeved top and long pants. If you have elbow and knee or shin pads, wear them. Lace up foot wear is also a great idea. If you don't have a BMX bike speak to your local club about whether or not they hire them. </p>

                    <h2>&#10104; If you're hooked and you want to get into it - don't buy a brand new bike to start with.</h2>
                    <p>Bikes can be very expensive brand new. Often, once you've been riding for a while, your taste for a particular type of bike changes. It's worth looking at Trade Me as an option to start with - there are always BMX race bikes available at great prices. Ask for help from someone from your local club - don't rush out and buy a bike without getting some advice.</p>

                    <p>You might have bought a bike by this stage, but if you haven't, you should speak to your local club about whether or not you can hire or borrow one for your first three meetings. Here at West Club (and most NZ clubs) you get your first three nights racing for free! This gives you the chance to see if you like it before you decide to get serious about it.</p>
